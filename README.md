# pychainladder
some basic actuarial methods in python. currently I have:
- basic converters between incremental and cumulative triangle types
- Chain Ladder (basic)
- Clark Cape Cod Method (LDF)

in development:
- Bayesian MCMC Models for Incurred Loss Triangles
  - Correlated Chain Ladder
  - Level Chain Ladder
- Bayesian MCMC Models for Paid Triangles
  - Correlated Incremental Trend
  - Level Incremental Trend
